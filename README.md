# Lulu B | Portfolio Website

This is the official personal portfolio website of **Lulu B (Benedict Wambua)**, a talented full-stack developer and musician. The project is built using pure **HTML5** and **CSS3**, with no JavaScript or external libraries, demonstrating how powerful modern CSS can be when creatively applied. It presents a unique blend of professionalism and creativity, tailored to reflect my passion for both coding and music.

The website is fully responsive and includes multiple interactive sections such as **Home**, **About**, **Education**, **Interests**, **Projects**, **Skills**, and **Contact**. At the top of the page is a fixed **navigation bar** that allows users to navigate between these sections. One of the standout features of this project is the **filter system** — implemented using only HTML and CSS — which displays only the selected section when a corresponding navigation link is clicked. This gives users a single-page app feel, even without JavaScript.

Another key feature is the **theme toggle** switch that lets users change between dark and light modes. This switch is implemented with a checkbox input and CSS custom properties (`--background`, `--text`, etc.) to dynamically update the theme without page reloads. It enhances accessibility and allows users to personalize their viewing experience.

The site also includes a **scroll progress bar** at the top that fills as the user scrolls down the page, giving real-time visual feedback. This is implemented using a styled `<progress>` element whose `value` updates according to the scroll position, again purely through CSS.

In the **About** section, users learn about my personal background and get a detailed list of my interests using an accordion-style layout. This section uses hidden checkboxes to toggle the display of content, offering interactivity without any scripts.

The **Education** section summarizes my academic journey through Kithimani and Borabu Technical Institute, while the **Projects** section showcases several of my works, including code previews and links to repositories. The layout is responsive and organized, helping users easily browse and understand what I’ve built.

In the **Skills** section, I display my proficiency in various areas like Music, Coding, Video Editing, and Content Writing. Each skill has a progress bar accompanied by a tooltip, showing the specific level visually and interactively.

The **Contact** section includes a form where visitors can send me messages, along with direct links to my social media platforms such as Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, and TikTok. These links are styled with hover effects to match the site’s theme and maintain consistent branding.

This project proves that complex interactive behavior like filtering content, toggling themes, and animating progress can all be achieved using only HTML and CSS. It's a clean, minimalistic, and accessible portfolio for anyone who wants to present their work without relying on JavaScript or external frameworks.

Whether you're a potential client, employer, collaborator, or fan of my music, this portfolio offers a simple and creative way to connect with me and explore my journey as a **developer and artist**.
